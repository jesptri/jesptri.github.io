## üèîÔ∏è About CNSNMM

The <a href="https://www.cnsnmm.sports.gouv.fr" target="_blank">**Centre National de Ski Nordique et de Moyenne Montagne**</a> (CNSNMM) is France‚Äôs national hub for Nordic skiing and mountain sports. Located in the Jura Mountains, the center focuses on high-performance athlete development and is home to the French national teams in biathlon, cross-country skiing, ski jumping, and Nordic combined. With cutting-edge facilities and research-driven training methods, the CNSNMM plays a key role in preparing athletes for international competition.

## üõ†Ô∏è What I Worked On

- I developed a full-stack analytics platform **from scratch**, tailored to the needs of national coaches. The tool provided new insights into athlete performance and helped reduce race analysis time by nearly **70%**.

- I worked closely with the French national biathlon staff to deliver detailed data reports ahead of the <a href="https://lenzerheide2025.ch/" target="_blank">**2025 Biathlon World Championships**</a> in Lenzerheide (Switzerland), where the team achieved a **record number of medals**.

- I was also involved in scientific monitoring activities, including support during **altitude simulation (hypoxia) sessions**, contributing to performance tracking and athlete adaptation protocols.

## üß† Challenges & Learnings

This was my **first professional experience**, and I was the only technical person on site. Without direct engineering support, I had to quickly become self-reliant and resourceful. Over the course of the internship, I taught myself key technologies such as:

- Web scraping for data gathering  
- Docker for deployment and reproducibility  
- Streamlit for front-end prototyping  
- PostgreSQL for database integration

I‚Äôm especially grateful to some close friends from <a href="https://www.isae-supaero.fr/" target="_blank">**ISAE-Supa√©ro**</a>, whose expertise I could regularly draw on, as well as to a few teachers who provided valuable feedback throughout the project. These interactions, combined with the hands-on nature of the work, significantly accelerated my learning curve.

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- **Streamlit (Python)**, **FastAPI**, **Docker**, **PostgreSQL**, **Selenium**

## üéø Fun Facts

- I had the chance to go cycling the French women national team during a training camp at the CNSNMM, definitely one of the best group ride of my life.  
- Simon FOURCADE, former biathlon world champion and national coach, called me while I was on a flight back from my Erasmus semester in Ireland.

    I had the chance to ride with <strong>Alex Baudin</strong> during his training camp at the CNSNMM. I also supported him during hypoxia sessions. Just a few weeks after, he wore the white jersey at the <strong>Giro d‚ÄôItalia</strong> for a few days.
