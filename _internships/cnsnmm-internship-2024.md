## 🏔️ About CNSNMM

The <a href="https://www.cnsnmm.sports.gouv.fr" target="_blank">**Centre National de Ski Nordique et de Moyenne Montagne**</a> (CNSNMM) 🇫🇷 is France’s national hub for Nordic skiing and mountain sports ⛷️🏃‍♂️. Located in the Jura Mountains 🏞️, the center focuses on high-performance athlete development and is home to the French 🇫🇷 national teams in biathlon, cross-country skiing, ski jumping, and Nordic combined. The CNSNMM plays a key role in preparing athletes for international competition 🥇🌍.

## 🛠️ What I Worked On

- I developed a full-stack analytics platform **from scratch**, tailored to the needs of national coaches. The tool provided new insights into athlete performance 📊 and helped reduce race analysis time by nearly **70%**.

- I worked closely with the French 🇫🇷 national biathlon staff to deliver detailed data reports ahead of the <a href="https://lenzerheide2025.ch/" target="_blank">**2025 Biathlon World Championships**</a> in Lenzerheide (Switzerland), where the team achieved a **record number of medals** 🥇🥈🥉.

- I was also involved in scientific monitoring activities 🔬, including support during **altitude simulation (hypoxia) sessions** ⛰️, contributing to performance tracking 📈 and athlete adaptation protocols 💨.

## 🧠 Challenges & Learnings

This was my **first professional experience** 💼, and I was the only technical person on site 🧑‍💻. Without direct engineering support, I had to quickly become self-reliant and resourceful 🧠. Over the course of the internship, I taught myself key technologies such as:

- 🕸️ Web scraping for data gathering  
- 🐳 Docker for deployment and reproducibility  
- 🧪 Streamlit for front-end prototyping (+ Python backend development) 
- 🗃️ PostgreSQL for database integration

I’m especially grateful to some close friends from <a href="https://www.isae-supaero.fr/" target="_blank">**ISAE-Supaéro**</a> 🎓, whose expertise I could regularly draw on, as well as to a few teachers who provided valuable feedback throughout the project. These interactions, combined with the hands-on nature of the work, significantly accelerated my learning curve.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Streamlit (Python)** 🐍, **FastAPI** 🚀, **Docker** 🐳, **PostgreSQL** 🗃️, **Selenium** 🕷️

## 🎿 Fun Facts

- I had the chance to go cycling 🚴‍♂️ with the French 🇫🇷 women national team during a training camp at the CNSNMM — definitely one of the best group rides of my life.  
- Simon FOURCADE, former biathlon world champion and national coach, called me while I was on a flight back from my Erasmus semester in Ireland 🇮🇪.

    I had the chance to ride 🚴‍♂️ with <strong>Alex Baudin</strong> during his training camp at the CNSNMM. I also supported him during hypoxia sessions. Just a few weeks after, he wore the white jersey at the <strong>Giro d’Italia</strong> for a few days.
