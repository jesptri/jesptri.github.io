## üéØ Context & Motivation

This internship opportunity came at the end of my gap year, just one month before starting my final year at <a href="https://www.isae-supaero.fr/" target="_blank">**ISAE-SUPAERO**</a>. I was actively seeking an internship experience in a startup environment, preferably outside of France, to broaden my international perspective and gain hands-on experience in a fast-paced tech environment.

The internship was structured in two phases:
- **August**: Full-time intensive work period
- **September onwards**: Part-time commitment (10 hours/week) alongside my studies, a common practice during the final year to accelerate professional experience

## üë• Team & Collaboration

I had the privilege of working with an exceptional team that significantly enhanced my learning experience:

- **2 Software Engineers** + 1 hybrid role (50% SWE / 50% non-tech work)
- **Daily collaboration** with an **ex-Google Software Engineer**, providing invaluable mentorship and industry insights
- **Regular interaction** with an **ex-McKinsey professional**, offering strategic business perspectives
- **Constant English communication**, this international environment pushed me to develop strong professional English skills

The learning ratio during this one-month intensive period was remarkably high, I discovered and learned significantly more than the time invested would typically suggest.

- Implemented end-to-end API testing to ensure robust system reliability

**CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions**
- Configured automated CI pipeline with GitHub Actions
