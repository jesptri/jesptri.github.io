## 📱 What I Worked On

During this 6-month internship, I was part of the **Mobile & Digital Experience team**, working at the intersection of product, tech, and UX. My main contributions:

- I developed a beta mobile application using **Flutter** for both iOS and Android, which expanded the tester base from 8 to over 120 users. This significantly accelerated feedback loops and **tripled feature validation speed**.

- I led the end-to-end development of core mobile features, and built **serverless REST APIs** with **Node.js** (AWS Lambda). I designed scalable data flows using **DynamoDB** and **S3**, ensuring fast and reliable performance.

- I automated multi-environment deployments and set up **CI/CD pipelines**, including release processes for both the **App Store** and **Google Play Store** — bringing the app closer to public readiness.

---

## 👥 Teamwork & UX

- I worked hand-in-hand with a **UX designer**, co-led ideation workshops, and conducted over **10 user interviews** to iterate on features based on real feedback.

- I took part in **daily Agile stand-ups**, sprint reviews, retrospectives, and planning meetings — gaining strong, hands-on experience with the **Scrum** methodology in a fast-moving tech/product team.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Flutter**, **Node.js**, **AWS (Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, API Gateway, etc)**, **GitLab CI/CD**, **Fastlane**

## 🧠 What I Took Away

This internship taught me how to ship features from **idea to production**, with a full-stack view — both technically and from a user experience standpoint. It also gave me insight into the real-life pace of product iteration in an industrial setting, and how much thought and polish go into seemingly simple features.

It was also a unique experience working at **Salomon’s headquarters** in the French Alps, surrounded by athletes, gear designers, and product testers — a truly outdoor-first environment with a strong tech mindset.
