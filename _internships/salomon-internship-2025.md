## 📱 What I Worked On

During this 6-month internship, I was part of the **IT team**.

- I took part in developing a beta mobile application for both iOS and Android. Initially tested by a handful of users, the app was later released to Salomon’s internal testers to gather valuable feedback.

- I led the end-to-end development of key mobile features and was also responsible for managing the backend.

- I set up three separate environments (dev/staging/prod) for the front-end, allowing me to dive deep into critical concepts such as **Auth0 authentication**, **CI/CD with GitLab**, and more.

- I automated the Play Store deployment using **GitLab CI/CD pipelines** and **Fastlane**.

## 👥 Collaboration & Teamwork

This experience was markedly different from my previous internship at CNSNMM.

I had the chance to work with:

- A **Senior Software Engineer** who mentored me throughout the internship (while working on other projects too). He acted as our **Product Owner** and occasionally contributed to development .

- A **UX Designer**, with whom I collaborated closely. We held monthly feedback sessions to refine the user experience and co-led ideation workshops and user interviews to iterate on features.

- **PhD students** working on AI-based training plans. I integrated their data collection requirements into the app to support the future implementation of their algorithms.

- I took part in **daily Agile stand-ups** within the broader IT team, which helped me build a solid understanding of Agile methodology 📅.

- Beyond my direct tasks, I proactively engaged with various IT professionals at Salomon, including **developers**, **DevOps**, **IT architects**, **data scientists**, **data engineers**, **analysts**, and **product owners**. These discussions gave me invaluable insights into both **Salomon’s tech landscape** and its overall business model.
