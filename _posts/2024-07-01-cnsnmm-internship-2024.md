## About CNSNMM

The <a href="https://www.cnsnmm.sports.gouv.fr" target="_blank">**Centre National de Ski Nordique et de Moyenne Montagne**</a> (CNSNMM) is France’s national hub for Nordic skiing and mountain sports. Located in the Jura Mountains, the center focuses on high-performance athlete development and is home to the **French national teams** in **biathlon**, **cross-country skiing**, **ski jumping**, and **nordic combined**. The CNSNMM plays a key role in preparing athletes for international competition 🌍.

## What I Worked On

- I developed a full-stack analytics platform **from scratch**, tailored to the needs of national coaches. The tool provided new insights into athlete race performance 📊.

- I worked closely with the French national biathlon staff to deliver detailed data reports ahead of the <a href="https://lenzerheide2025.ch/" target="_blank">**2025 Biathlon World Championships**</a> in Lenzerheide (Switzerland), where the team achieved a **record number of medals** 🥇.

- I was also involved in scientific monitoring activities, including support during **altitude simulation (hypoxia) sessions**, contributing to performance tracking and athlete adaptation protocols.

## Challenges & Learnings

This was my **first professional experience**, and I was the only technical person on site. Without direct engineering support, I had to quickly become self-reliant and resourceful.

I am especially grateful to some friends from <a href="https://www.isae-supaero.fr/" target="_blank">**ISAE-SUPAERO**</a> 🎓, whose expertise I could regularly draw on, as well as to a few teachers who provided valuable feedback throughout the project. These interactions, combined with the hands-on nature of the work, significantly accelerated my learning curve.

## Tech Stack

- **Streamlit (Python)**, **FastAPI**, **Docker**, **PostgreSQL**, **GitLab CI**, **Selenium**

---

## Fun Facts

- I had the chance to go cycling with the French women national team during a training camp at the CNSNMM (definitely one of the best group rides of my life!).  
- Simon FOURCADE, former biathlon champion (Martin FOURCADE, his brother is a former biathlon world champion) and national coach, called me while I was on a flight back from my Erasmus semester in Ireland (to fix missing data on the dashboard).

      I had the chance to ride with <strong>Alex Baudin</strong> during his training camp at the CNSNMM. I also supported him during hypoxia sessions. Just a few weeks after, he wore the white jersey at the <strong>Giro d’Italia</strong> for a few days.
