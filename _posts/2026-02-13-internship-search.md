## Introduction

Let me set the scene: summer 2025, I was deep in the internship hunt, applying to every big tech company (I focused on the main ones like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Meta). I was convinced I had a shot, until the rejections started pouring in. **FAANGS didn’t want me.** My CV was getting filtered out by ATS systems, my LeetCode skills were probably not good enough, and I was starting to question if I would ever land anything decent.

Fast forward to today: I am writing this as a future **Software Engineer Intern at Mistral AI**, one of the hottest AI companies in Europe. How did I get here? Through a mix of relentless preparation, aggressive networking, and a few lucky breaks. Here is the full, unfiltered story, including the failures, the lessons, and the moments that made all the difference.

## **1. Building a Profile That Stands Out (The CV has to be more than a simple piece of paper!)**

I knew my CV had to be **sharp**. Not just a list of experiences, but something that would make recruiters pause and think, *"This guy’s worth a call."* I focused on:
- **CV formulation:** I found many sources on the internet that can help people build strong ATS-oriented CVs. In particular I found this guy [Sajaad Khader](https://www.youtube.com/@SajjaadKhader) sharing super interesting advice to get a job/internship in a big tech company. The basics is to display the impact you had in every single bulletpoint you write on your CV, they have to contain numbers.
- **Personal projects:** I had to build projects, or to take part in events that could make me gain experience. It was about having a nice GitHub, it was about having something interesting to talk about in interviews. I went back on my first year C project. The Sokoban game to program in C, it was tough, at this time I was not good at all in low-level programming languages. So I focused on learning or reviewing the basics of computer science in general (basically data structures, memory management, a project structure, etc). I tried to reproduce the project and this time to finish it. It was worth the time and I was sincerely very happy when I extended the project with a (very simple) UI interface with Streamlit to play the game. I also took part in a Hackathon in June 2025. It was organized by the French tech ministery in order to improve open-source solutions replacing big tech solutions to improve the European sovereignty.
