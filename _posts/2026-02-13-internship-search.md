## Introduction

Let me set the scene: summer 2025, I was deep in the internship hunt, applying to every big tech company (I focused on the main ones like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Meta). I was convinced I had a shot, until the rejections started pouring in. **FAANGS didn’t want me.** My CV was getting filtered out by ATS systems, my LeetCode skills were probably not good enough, and I was starting to question if I would ever land anything decent.

Fast forward to today: I am writing this as a future **Software Engineer Intern at Mistral AI**, one of the hottest AI companies in Europe. How did I get here? Through a mix of relentless preparation, aggressive networking, and a few lucky breaks. Here is the full, unfiltered story, including the failures, the lessons, and the moments that made all the difference.

## **1. Building a Profile That Stands Out (The CV has to be more than a simple piece of paper!)**

I knew my CV had to be **sharp**. Not just a list of experiences, but something that would make recruiters pause and think, *"This guy’s worth a call."* I focused on:
- **CV formulation:** I found many sources on the internet that can help people build strong ATS-oriented CVs. In particular I found this guy [Sajaad Khader](https://www.youtube.com/@SajjaadKhader) sharing super interesting advice to get a job/internship in a big tech company. The basics is to display the impact you had in every single bulletpoint you write on your CV, they have to contain numbers.
- **Personal projects:** I had to build projects, or to take part in events that could make me gain experience. It was about having a nice GitHub, it was about having something interesting to talk about in interviews. I went back on my first year C project. The Sokoban game to program in C, it was tough, at this time I was not good at all in low-level programming languages. So I focused on learning or reviewing the basics of computer science in general (basically data structures, memory management, a project structure, etc). I tried to reproduce the project and this time to finish it. It was worth the time and I was sincerely very happy when I extended the project with a (very simple) UI interface with Streamlit to play the game. I also took part in a Hackathon in June 2025. It was organized by the French tech ministery in order to improve open-source solutions replacing big tech solutions to improve the European sovereignty. 

### **Interview Prep: The LeetCode Grind**
I will be honest: doing my first DSA exercice I hated LeetCode. But I did it anyway.
I started by reviewing Data Structures and Algorithms from a first year computer science course. It was not easy. Arrays, sets, hashmaps, linked-lists, etc. But understanding these data structures is key and really made me understand the advantages/downsides of these different elements. I used [AlgoMap](https://www.algomap.io/) to track my progress and make sure I wasn’t missing any key topics. Instead of trying as many exercices as I could, I focused on learning key patterns that would allow me to be able to solve any LeetCode exercice. I also did **mock interviews** with friends, it helped me stop blanking out when someone asked me to explain my thought process, solving an easy exercice may be easy but explaining your thoughts in real-time really is difficult and you have to practice to become better doing it.
I also practiced **behavioral questions**. Yes, they’re annoying, but they matter a lot. Especially before Amazon interviews, I focused on their Leadership Principles (LP) and prepared a good number of stories that I could adapt to any LP that was asked.

### **Experience: An-extra Internship to build my CV**
I was about to finish my internship at Salomon at the beginning of 2025 summer that I started to plan August month. It was the end of my gap-year before going back to school in September, I thought taking holidays to rest was a good idea but knowing I had ambitions for my end-of-studies and what would follow, I thought adding an experience to my CV would be a good idea. So I started to apply for internships, I was interested in getting an international experience, I thought it would be nice to work in english but also to discover how work works in other countries. I found an internship in Luxembourg (yes it's quite familiar to France but it was actually more english than french), my colleagues were either Belgian or Dutch which made me practice my english a lot.
