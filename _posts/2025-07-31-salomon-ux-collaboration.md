<!-- ## 🧭 From Tech to Insight: A UX-Led Approach -->

As part of my **software engineer internship at Salomon**, I had the opportunity to work closely with a **UX Designer** on the early stages of product ideation for a new mobile application. 
Our mission was to design **features that matter to runners**.

## 📱 1. Competitor Analysis: Mapping the Landscape

We began by conducting an in-depth **benchmark of existing mobile apps** in the running and outdoor sports space:

- Apps like **Strava**, **Nolio**, **Kiprun Pacer**, **Adidas Running** were analyzed.
- We identified the **strengths and weaknesses** of each app in terms of value, user experience, and purpose.
- This allowed us to distinguish between different **app types**:
  - Coaching-focused apps (like **Run Motion Coach**)
  - Route discovery apps (like **Komoot**)
  - Brand-first promotional apps (like **Nike Run Club**)
  - Community/social-driven platforms (like **Strava**)

This analysis gave us both **design inspiration** (by noticing interesting features) and a clearer picture of **gaps in the market**.

## 🗣️ 2. Interviews with Trail Runners

To go deeper and get a better undestanding of what trail runners waiting for their training app, we prepared and ran a **series of qualitative interviews** with a wide range of runners. The process included:

- Drafting an interview guide focused on identifying **user profiles**, habits, tools, frustrations, and must-have features for a hypothetical Salomon app.
- Conducting **10 in-depth interviews** (30–45 minutes each), covering detailed aspects of each runner’s training style and tool usage.
- Extracting insights and pain points to feed into ideation workshops.

This phase helped us cluster runners into **3–4 typical profiles**, which were later used to prioritize features and scenarios.

## 💡 3. Ideation Workshops with Trail Runners

We then hosted **ideation sessions** with trail runners. We explored **feature possibilities** based on insights from the interviews:

- We selected **3–4 key feature themes** to focus on.
- Workshop structure:
  - **10 min**: introduction & context
  - **15–20 min**: individual sketching or idea generation
  - **10 min**: collective post-it sharing
  - **20–30 min**: open discussion to refine promising concepts

Following the sessions, I co-led a **synthesis** phase with the UX designer to outline **next steps** for design and implementation (even beyond the end of my internship).

## 🎨 4. What’s Next: Prototyping  

Although I wasn’t involved in this phase directly (it's planned for after the end of my internship), we outlined a roadmap for:

- Turning selected features into **UX mockups**
- Running reviews with **Product Owners** and **Designers**
- Iterating based on internal and external feedback

---

## 🚀 Reflection

This experience was a major highlight of my internship. As a future engineer, being involved in **user-centered research** gave me a deeper understanding of what truly makes a feature valuable. It also emphasized how much thoughtful design work happens **before a single line of code is written**.
