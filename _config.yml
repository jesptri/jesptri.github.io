# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# If you need help with YAML syntax, here are some quick references for you:

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I'm a final-year engineering student at [**ISAE-SUPAERO**](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/), currently specializing in **Data Science, Artificial Intelligence**, and **Complex Systems Modeling**, blending machine learning, statistical modeling, high-performance computing, and multiscale simulation.

  I'm actively looking for my **end-of-studies internship** (6 months), starting around **March/April 2026**. 
  Iâ€™m particularly interested in roles involving **AI technologies** and **software development**, such as **Software Engineer**, **Data Scientist**, or **Machine Learning Engineer**.
  I'm also strongly interested in **international opportunities** and open to relocation for the right project or team.
