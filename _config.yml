# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I'm a final-year engineering student at [**ISAE-SUPAERO**](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/).

  Starting September, I’ll specialize in **Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Complex Systems Modeling**, combining:
  - 📊 Machine Learning & Statistical Modeling  
  - 💾 Data Engineering & High-Performance Computing  
  - 📈 Multiscale Simulation, Optimization & Uncertainty Quantification  
  - 🧠 Applied Data Science: Privacy, Ethics & Economics  

  I'm currently looking for my **end-of-studies internship** (6 months), starting around **March/April 2026** 📅.
  I'm particularly interested in roles such as **Software Engineer**, **Data Scientist**, or **Machine Learning Engineer** 🤖, and more broadly in internships involving AI technologies and software development.
  I'm also very interested in **international opportunities** 🌍 and open to relocating for the right team or project.
