# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# If you need help with YAML syntax, here are some quick references for you:

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I am a final-year engineering student at [**ISAE-SUPAERO**](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/), with a strong focus on **Data Science**, **AI**, and **Complex Systems Modeling**.

  I am currently seeking a **6-month end-of-studies internship** starting around **March/April 2026**. 
  I am especially keen on challenging roles related to **artificial intelligence** and **software engineering**.

  I thrive in international environments and am open to relocating to join an ambitious team working on meaningful problems.
